        <p>hey <span style="color: green;">!!!</span></p><br><br>
        <p class="bdy">
            Iâ€™m SK Kishore, a driven and enthusiastic third-year <span style="color: green;"> B.Tech</span> student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in <span style="color: green;"> Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber Security, and Blockchain Technology</span>.
            My academic pursuits are centered around exploring cutting-edge technologies that have the potential to shape the future, and I am particularly passionate about ethical hacking and full-stack development with a strong focus on back-end technologies.
            My goal is to build secure, efficient, and innovative systems that stand at the intersection of technology and security. <br><br> Outside of academics, my interests extend to science fiction films, where the limitless exploration of futuristic
            ideas fuels my creativity and inspires me to think beyond conventional boundaries. I also turn to music as a source of relaxation and balance, helping me stay grounded as I continue to push forward in my learning journey. <br><br> Currently,
            I am expanding my skill set by diving into <span style="color: green;"> Kotlin </span>, enhancing my knowledge in Android app development to further diversify my technical capabilities. With a solid foundation in languages such as <span style="color: green;"> Python, Java, C, C++,  </span>and
            growing proficiency in JavaScript and Kotlin, I am constantly learning and adapting to the rapidly changing tech landscape. <br><br> As I step into the early stages of my professional journey, my immediate goal is to secure a role that offers
            opportunities for growth, continuous learning, and the chance to contribute to meaningful projects. I am inspired by the journey of <span style="color: green;"> Mr.Sundar Pichai </span>, whose success story motivates me to aim for excellence
            and push myself to new heights in my career. While I recognize that the path to success is not without its challenges, I believe that my perseverance, dedication, and passion for technology will guide me along the way. <br><br> This portfolio
            serves as the first step toward showcasing my skills, experiences, and the relentless drive that fuels my ambition. I invite you to explore my projects, learn more about my journey, and join me as I work towards achieving my dreams in the
            world of technology.
